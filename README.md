let's create a simplified CI/CD pipeline for a web application using GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker. Here's a step-by-step guide:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project: Simple Web Application CI/CD Pipeline

Tools and Technologies:

GitHub: Version control and source code hosting.
Jenkins: Automation server for building, testing, and deploying.
Docker: Containerization for application deployment.
Web Application: A basic "Hello World" web application (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
Steps:

1. GitHub Setup:

Create a new public GitHub repository for your web application.
Clone the repository to your local development environment.
2. Develop the Web Application:

Create a simple "index.html" file with a "Hello, World!" message.
Commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository.
3. Jenkins Setup:

Install and configure Jenkins on a server or your local machine.
Install necessary plugins, including the GitHub plugin for integration.
4. Jenkins Pipeline:

Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
In the pipeline configuration, connect the job to your GitHub repository.

Write a simple Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages:
Groovy:
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the code from GitHub repository
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Build and Dockerize') {
            steps {
                // Build Docker image for the web application
                sh 'docker build -t simple-web-app .'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Run the Docker container on port 8080
                sh 'docker run -d -p 8080:80 simple-web-app'
            }
        }
    }
}

5. Docker Setup:
   Dockerfile:
Create a Dockerfile in your GitHub repository's root directory:

# Use an official Nginx runtime as the base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the index.html file into the container
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
6. GitHub Webhook:

Configure a webhook in your GitHub repository settings to trigger the Jenkins pipeline on each push.
7. Testing the Pipeline:

Make changes to the web application code (e.g., modify the message in "index.html").
Push the changes to the GitHub repository.
Observe how Jenkins automatically triggers the pipeline via the webhook.
8. Deployment:

After the pipeline successfully completes, access the deployed application in a web browser by navigating to http://<your-server-ip>:8080.
This simplified pipeline automates the process of building a Docker image from your web application code and deploying it using Nginx. You can enhance this pipeline by adding more stages for testing, deploying to production environments, and improving error handling.

Keep in mind that real-world CI/CD pipelines might involve more complex scenarios, security considerations, and integrations with tools like Kubernetes, AWS, or other cloud platforms.







pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME = "your-image-name"
        DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME = "your-container-name"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Deploy Docker Container') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def dockerImage = "${DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME}:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
                    def containerName = "${DOCKER_CONTAINER_NAME}-${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"

                    // Stop and remove the existing container if it exists
                    try {
                        sh "docker stop ${containerName} || true"
                        sh "docker rm ${containerName} || true"
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        echo "Error stopping/removing container: ${e}"
                    }

                    // Pull and run the new container
                    sh "docker run -d --name ${containerName} -p 80:80 ${dockerImage}"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Docker deployment was successful!'
        }

        failure {
            echo 'Docker deployment failed!'
        }
    }
}
